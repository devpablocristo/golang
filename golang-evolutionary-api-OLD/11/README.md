Your `README.md` file is quite comprehensive, but there are some formatting issues and a bit of duplication in the content. Here's a revised version with improved formatting:

# Example API

This is a basic web application written in Go using the Gin web framework.

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

To start the Docker containers, use the `make` command:

```bash
sudo make up
```

Check the `Makefile` for more commands.

This command will launch two containers:
- **MySQL**: A MySQL database container.
- **phpMyAdmin**: A web interface for managing the MySQL database.

#### Accessing phpMyAdmin

To manage the MySQL database via phpMyAdmin:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:9090`.
2. On the login screen, use the following credentials:
   - **Server**: `mysql-local`
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Password**: `root`
3. Once inside phpMyAdmin, you can create a new database or manage existing ones.

#### Creating the Database

To create a database:
1. In phpMyAdmin, go to the "SQL" tab.
2. Load the SQL file located in the `db` directory of your project.
3. Execute the script to create the database and necessary tables.

The server will start, and you can access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Description

This project manages `items` that sellers sell on a marketplace. The API provides CRUD operations for `items`, each governed by specific business rules.

### Items

An item contains basic information about a product that will be listed on our platform.

#### Item Representation

Example JSON representation of an item:

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "code": "SAM27324354",
  "title": "Tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab S7",
  "description": "Galaxy Tab S7 with S Pen SM-t733 12.4 inches and 4GB RAM",
  "price": 150000.35,
  "stock": 3,
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2020-05-10T04:20:33Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-05-10T05:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Rules for Items

1. IDs are generated automatically.
2. Fields `code`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `stock`, and `photos` are mandatory.
3. `code` must be unique.
4. `status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are generated by the system and cannot be modified via the API.
5. `status` can be `ACTIVE` (item with available stock) or `INACTIVE` (item with zero stock).

#### Operations

1. **Create New Items**
   - **POST** `v1/items`
   - Example body: `{ "code": "NEWITEM123", "title": "New Item", ... }`

2. **Update an Item**
   - **PUT** `v1/items/{id}`
   - Example body: `{ "code": "ITEM123", "title": "Updated Item", ... }`

3. **Get an Item by ID**
   - **GET** `v1/items/{id}`

4. **Delete an Item**
   - **DELETE** `v1/items/{id}`

5. **Get All Items (with optional filtering by Status)**
   - **GET** `v1/items?status={status}&limit={limit}`
   - Filters: `status` (optional), `limit` (optional, default: 10, max: 20)
