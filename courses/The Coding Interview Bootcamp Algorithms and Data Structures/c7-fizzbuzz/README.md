# Directions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.  

## Example

fizzBuzz(15) = [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz]
