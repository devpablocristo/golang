    * A- Yes.
    * B- No.
    * C- Sometimes.
    * D- Both.

2. What is the usage of the break statement in Go? 
    The break statement is used to: 
    * A- Terminate the for loop or switch statement.
    * B- Terminate the if/else statement. 
    * C- Terminate a recursive function.
    * D- Escape an interface.

3. What is a map in Go?
    * A- Is a store for location data.
    * B- Is a variable that is used to store the memory address of another variable.
    * C- Is a key-value store.
    * D- Is a type for concurrent programming.	

4. Can you return multiple values from a function?
    * A- Only if one of the values is an error.
    * B- Yes. 
    * C- No.
    * D- This is only valid for methods, not functions. 

5. What are structs in Go? What are they used for?
    * A- Is ORM data type. It allows us to interact with a database engine. 
    * B- Is a behavior driven type. It allows us to describe desired behavior. 
    * C- Is a goroutine group. It allows us to execute functions independently and simultaneously.  
    * D- Is a composite data type. It allows us to compose together values of different types.

6. Does Go support type encapsulation?
    * A- Yes, only on public and protected methods.
    * B- No, Go is not an object oriented programming language.
    * C- Yes, using the capitalized and non-capitalized formats.
    * D- No, Go works only with packages. 

7. What's the difference between functions and methods in Go?
    * A- There is no difference.
    * B- A method is nothing more than a function attached to a type.
    * C- A method is a function that belongs to a package.
    * D- Functions can return multiple values, methods only one.

8. What are interfaces in Go?
    * A- Interfaces are a special type in Go that define a set of method signatures but do not provide implementations.
    * B- Interfaces are a special type in Go that define a set of method signatures and  implementations.
    * C- Interfaces are a special type in Go that define a set of functions but do not provide implementations. 
    * D- Interfaces are a special type in Go that define a set of functions and implementations.

9. What are empty interfaces in go?	
    * A- Are an abstraction of the interface type. Can hold values of any type.
    * B- Are interfaces that specify zero variables, functions and structs. Can be accessed from anywhere. 
    * C- Are interfaces that specify zero methods. Can hold values of any type.
    * D- Are interfaces that are empty of error handling. Can be used to test errors. 

10. What is Context? What is Golang context used for?
    * A- Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
    * B- Context is a special structure, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
    * C- A variable that holds the Context of an interface, such as methods, values and errors. 
    * D- A variable that defines the scope of a type.
